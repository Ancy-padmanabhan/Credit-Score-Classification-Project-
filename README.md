# Credit-Score-Classification-Project-

Credit scoring is a fundamental process in financial decision-making. A credit score is a critical factor used by lenders to evaluate the credit risk associated with lending money to a borrower. It is based on an individual's credit history, financial behaviors, and other relevant factors. A reliable credit score prediction model helps prevent defaults and reduce financial losses for lenders.
  Credit scoring plays a pivotal role in the financial industry, serving as a primary tool for evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals. Traditionally, credit scores have been calculated using statistical models based on historical data. However, with the advent of big data and machine learning, there is potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of these scores by leveraging more sophisticated algorithms that can handle complex, non-linear relationships between variables.
Objectives:
1.	To preprocess and analyses the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
2.	To build and evaluate multiple classification models for predicting credit scores.
3.	To optimize the model to achieve the highest possible accuracy while avoiding overfitting.
4.	To deploy the final model for practical use in credit risk assessment.
